      <p>This is Kenzing, The <strong>dream dog</strong> that I have always <em>dreamt</em> of having. Well, I have already given him a name
        because I believe one day I will be able to own him.<em>(Call that crazy dreams)</em> LOL. Well I love German shepherds
        because they generally are:
         <ul>
           <li>Smart</li>
           <li>Easy to train</li>
           <li>Great companions</li>
           <li>And of course they are easy to handle</li>
        </ul>
        German shepherds are also generally known to be well behaved. This is because of their natural instincts
        to protect and serve their masters.</p>
 <h1>Kenzing's skills</h1>
  <p>Kenzing is a smart dog and he can do more than just being a dog.
    Below are some of the things he can do</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Sniff and track- I must admit that this is one of his top qualities</li>
       <li>Guard - Of course every dog can do that but he does it with passion</li>
       <li>Guide - He can guide a blind person to and from the shopping centre</li>
       <li>Bite on command</li>
    </ol>
    <h1><strong>Kenzings Favorite games</strong></h1>
       <p>Kenzing is not a dormant dog, He also likes to play a lot.
       Below is a list of the favorite games he likes to play</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Catch</li>
         <li>Fetch</li>
         <li>Chase</li>
      </ul>
    <p>He is also a very handsome dog and I bet you all might want to see his other photos. Don't worry
      I got you all covered</p>
